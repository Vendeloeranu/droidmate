/**
 * This settings.gradle exists because this project cannot be wired normally to the build due to: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-122904
 * Instead, it is called as external Gradle script in 'core' project build.gradle, by virtue of being a dependency 
 * of task 'assembleUiautomator2Daemon'.
 * 
 * Because this project depends on :uiautomator-daemon-lib, which lives beside this project, some modifications had to be made 
 * in this file.
 * 
 * See also: 
 *   https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#sub:modifying_element_of_the_project_tree
